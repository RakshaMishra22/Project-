****📑 Introduction****
 This project demonstrates my complete workflow for handling a business dataset from raw data to meaningful insights. I started by thoroughly cleaning and preparing the data in Excel, ensuring it was accurate and analysis-ready. Next, I used SQL to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) and important metrics that form the backbone of the analysis.
To bring the data to life, I designed detailed and interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau, showcasing how the same dataset can be visualized and interpreted through different tools and perspectives. Each dashboard highlights trends, patterns, and actionable insights that support data-driven decision making.
This repository reflects my ability to combine data preparation, query writing, and visualization skills to deliver clear, insightful, and professional reports — all in one place.
