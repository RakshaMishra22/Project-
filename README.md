**Zomato Global Restaurants Analysis Dashboard**     


****📑 Introduction****     
**🔍 1️⃣ Data Cleaning and Preparation (Excel)**     
1. Began by cleaning the raw data in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency.     
2. Identified and removed duplicate rows.     
3. Handled missing values by filling, replacing, or removing them as appropriate.     
4. Standardized inconsistent data entries (e.g., date formats, text cases).     
5. Converted all transaction values from various currencies to Indian Rupees (INR) for consistent comparison and reporting.     
6. Extracted date parts (day, month, year) from unstructured date columns and reconstructed them into a proper date format for accurate time-based analysis.     
7. Cleaned and standardized city names and country codes to ensure geographic data was uniform and reliable.     
8. Added calculated columns where needed for deeper insights.     
9. Organized the dataset into clean, structured tables ready for SQL queries and dashboard imports.     

**🗂️ 2️⃣ Data Extraction and Analysis (SQL)**
1. Connected to the cleaned dataset and created relational structures where needed.     
2. Wrote queries to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics such as total profit, sales growth, and customer segments.     
3. Performed aggregations and used window functions to compare current vs. previous periods.     
4. Validated results to ensure accuracy and relevance for visualization.     

**📈 3️⃣ Interactive Dashboards (Power BI)**     
1. Imported the prepared data and built data models with relationships and hierarchies.     
2. Created KPI cards, slicers, and filters for dynamic exploration.     
3. Designed clear, interactive visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and treemaps.     
4. Added bookmarks and advanced tooltips for an enhanced user experience.     
5. Focused on intuitive layouts and easy navigation between dashboard pages.     
     
**📊 4️⃣ Visual Storytelling (Tableau)**     
1. Connected to the same dataset and replicated similar insights for comparison.     
2. Built multiple dashboards highlighting trends, outliers, and performance breakdowns.     
3. Used calculated fields and parameters for advanced interactivity.     
4. Applied dynamic filters and actions to enable deep dives into specific segments.     
5. Ensured the design is clean, responsive, and informative.
